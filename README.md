Cheltenham Festival 2016 on Twitter
===================================

**This did not go to plan**

Repo contains tweets collecting using the [streamR](https://github.com/pablobarbera/streamR/) package that "belong" to the 2016 Cheltenham Festival, for days two and three, collection issues hampered day one and four, there will be no blogs about the collected data.
